title: Supporting Yourself
description: Sometimes, life knocks us down and leaves us wondering how we're
  going to get back up. We all need help at some point, but the world can be
  pretty forgiving if you know where to look. This section includes topics like
  how to get resources like food or clothing in a time of need, how to help
  yourself mentally, and how to use the different student resources available
  on- and off-campus.
