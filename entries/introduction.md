# Motivation
Part of me got tired seeing the same questions answered time and time again on r/utdallas. They're well-meaning, but when someone asks a question that can be easily answered with Google, it bugs me.

In short, I want someone to be able to open this document, press Ctrl + F, and search for what they need.

Administration moves too slow, so I made this as a stop-gap measure until the freshman year experience was made more coherent.

# Purpose
This guide is tailored to students entering UTD, whether those just out of high school, traditional transfer students, or nontraditional students, but is structured to be most useful to freshmen entering from high school. Despite this guide's focus on freshmen, it functionally serves as the canon for student information.

Translation: this will be UTD's bible, a source of truth for basically anything relevant to students.

This guide maintains some level of formality and geniality, but it's not afraid to be completely honest with the realities of going to school here.

This guide is supposed to be thorough but easily scannable. Each section contains TL;DRs, but I recommend you try reading further if you have the time. It has answers to a lot of the questions you'll have during your time as a student.

The University of Texas at Dallas is a wonderful place once you get to know it. Hopefully you find some utility from this handbook.

Eventually, this will become a website on its own and maybe a set of resources for students at other universities across the nation to use and replicate. Hopefully, this will stand the test of time and be useful for years to come.
