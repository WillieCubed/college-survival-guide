# College Survival Guide
*A repository of things I wish I knew back in freshman year.*
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/26153b88-659f-4037-80a7-3834a02d578b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/collegesurvivalguide/deploys)

To see the WIP, go to the Netlify [site](https://collegesurvivalguide.netlify.app/).

## Development
To start the local development server, run `npm run develop`.

### Deployment
To produce a build for deployment, run `npm run build`. This will create a
`dist/` directory that can be deployed to any static hosting provider.

This project uses Netlify for hosting and Netlify CMS to manage website content.

To visit the CMS dashboard, go to `/admin.`
